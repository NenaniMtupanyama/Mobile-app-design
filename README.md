Budgeting App                

I want to create an application that will help families and individuals in making their monthly budget economically and efficiently. This app will allow them to manually enter their monthly income and enter their expenses and group them into different customary made and built in categories. It will also allow them to set expense limits for each category of expenditure and allow them to set budget goals for that monthly 
income. It will also remind them of the important expense that are due to come and will generate a report on how they spent their money based on different categories of expenditures at the end of the month
